Strata adds layers of stone, called strata, into the world. Each strata is harder than the last, needing a higher tier pickaxe to mine.<br />
Stone in the first strata is vanilla Minecraft stone, and can be mined as usual.<br />
Stone in the second strata requires at least an Iron Pickaxe to mine.<br />
Stone in the third strata requires at least a Diamond Pickaxe to mine.<br />
Ore is only affected visually, and can be mined with the same pickaxe as the ore it is based off of.
